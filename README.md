# Stunning-Analytics

My name is Diogo Santos and I'm a Portuguese Data Scientist. My journey in this field started 1 year ago and since then my passion for data has been increasing.

In my repository I will be posting works for personal purposes where analytics can be used, but also works for competitions on Kaggle using Jupyter Notebooks with explanations about the results but also some code of course. Coding is part of our life!

Thank you very much and good analysis for all!
